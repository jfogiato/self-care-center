# Self-Care Center 

## Abstract:
[//]: <> 
Given a comp, I built out an application that allows users to receive either an affirmation or mantra. The user is then given a randomly generated message with words of encouragement and guidance. Additionally, users can also generate their own mantra or affirmation which is then displayed on the page. 

## Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> 
1. Fork and clone [this repo](https://github.com/jfogiato/self-care-center)
1. Copy the SSH key from the green "Code" button within the repo.
1. In your terminal, use the command `git clone git@github.com:[the link to your repo]`.
1. Open the repo in your text editor to make any changes or inspect code.
1. Use `open index.html` to open the app in your browser.

## Context:
[//]: <>
For this project, a comp image was given to us and we were tasked with replecating the style and layout in our application. We had an MVP requirement to be able to generate random affirmations and mantras from a given list. Additionally, I chose to add a feature to allow users to submit their own message via form. This project took approximately 10 hours to complete. This was the third project in Mod 1 of Turing, and the second solo project of the program so far.

## Learning Goals:
[//]: <>
The learning goals of this project were (1) to gain experience building an app that utilizes HTML, CSS, and Javascript, (2) write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp, (3) understand how to listen to and respond to user events, and (4) continue to individualize my programming skill set. 

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, VS Code, DevTools, Git, GitHub, and the command line to complete this project.

## Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> 
One win that I am proud of is the ability of the app to be open-ended while in a user session. Initially, once the user opted to create their own message, that option went away and you could only generate a random message. Through some restructuring of the code, I was able to build out functionality that allows the user to continue to build their own message and receive pre-selected messages infinitely.

This project also allowed me to gain greater insight into using CSS flex boxes to make the application page more dynamic with regards to how the DOM is displayed. Rather than hard-coding styling for each element to match the comp, I utilized flex boxes to align elements accordingly which allows the page to look presentable on any size screen.

Although ultimately I consider the CSS portion of this project a "win", it was also a challenge. Understanding how nested elements interact both with one another and inside their parent element when using CSS flex was challenging and took lots of trial and error.
